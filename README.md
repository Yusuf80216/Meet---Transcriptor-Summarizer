# Virtual Meetings Summarizer
In the work from home scenario prevailing over the last 18 months and with hybrid working picking steam, most Official meetings have been or will be conducted virtually. While MICROSOFT TEAMS / Google Meet / Zoom do provide a feature to download TRANSCRIPT, it does not summarise the meeting.


#### Problem Dimensions :

- Parse the Transcript to figure out many attendees were there in the meeting.
- Duration of the meeting
- Most importantly produce a gist / summary of the meeting
- List the Action items if they are specifically called out.
- Incase where Transcript is not available, you will have to additionally work on converting SPEECH to TEXT
